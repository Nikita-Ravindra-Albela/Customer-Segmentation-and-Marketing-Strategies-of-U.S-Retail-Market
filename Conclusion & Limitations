##Conclusion

This study provides a comprehensive exploration of customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies within the U.S. retail market, with shopping malls serving as a case example in the context of rising e-commerce adoption. Using Pareto and RFM models, the analysis validates the 80/20 principle by showing that a small group of high-value customers drives a disproportionate share of revenue, underscoring the need for focused retention initiatives.

The segmentation by age, gender, payment method, and purchase behavior highlights clear patterns: female shoppers and customers aged 26-45 are the most engaged and profitable, with credit card users contributing higher transaction volumes. RFM analysis further identifies Recent, Others, and Lost groups, each requiring tailored strategies retention campaigns for Recent, reactivation offers for Lost, and loyalty reinforcement for Others. Pareto findings also emphasize the dominance of categories such as Clothing, Shoes, and Technology, which together account for over 90% of revenue and warrant inventory prioritization and targeted promotions.

Recommendations:

•	Cross-promotions: Partner with food courts and entertainment zones to redirect leisure visitors toward retail stores through bundled offers and joint campaigns.
•	Omnichannel integration: Collaborate with online platforms to ensure consistent pricing, while enabling seamless return and exchange policies across both physical and digital channels.
•	Accessibility: Enhance layouts, seating, and navigation to create a more user-friendly shopping experience for older customers.
•	Youth targeting: Launch student-focused discounts and promotional campaigns to attract young adults who are frequent mall visitors.
•	Diversification: Broaden store offerings by introducing health-oriented outlets, technology hubs, and complementary accessory brands (bags, perfumes, cosmetics) to increase customer basket size.
•	Brand onboarding: Identify high-performing online brands and introduce them in physical malls with exclusive in-person launch offers to boost both footfall and revenue.

In conclusion, this project affirms that data-driven segmentation is not merely tactical but a strategic imperative. By aligning behavioral insights with operational innovation, omnichannel partnerships, and customer-centric strategies, U.S. retailers can optimize experiences, maximize revenue opportunities, and sustain growth in an increasingly hybrid retail landscape.

##This study also underscored how e-commerce players like Amazon disrupted traditional retail by mastering warehouse-driven logistics and premium delivery models. In contrast, niche segments like grocery continue to rely on store-level distribution due to shelf-life constraints highlighting why brick-and-mortar strategies must adapt differently across categories

##Limitations

While this study provides valuable insights into customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies in the U.S. retail market, certain limitations must be acknowledged:
•	Data Scope: The dataset used was limited to 3,900 customers from a single source (Rubixe -AI Solutions Company), which may not fully represent the diversity of the entire U.S. retail market.
•	Time Frame: The analysis reflects a specific time period and may not capture seasonal or long-term behavioral shifts.
•	Geographic Bias: The dataset does not include regional identifiers, limiting the ability to analyze geographic variations in consumer behavior.
•	Category Saturation: Revenue was heavily concentrated in a few categories (Clothing, Shoes, Technology), which may skew strategic recommendations if broader category data is not considered.
•	Payment Method Assumptions: While trends in payment preferences were observed, external factors such as promotions, card incentives, or store policies were not accounted for.
•	Limited Qualitative Insights: The study primarily relies on quantitative analysis; customer motivations, sentiments, and experiential factors were not explored in depth.
Future research could benefit from a larger, more diverse dataset, inclusion of qualitative feedback, and longitudinal tracking to validate behavioral trends over time.
