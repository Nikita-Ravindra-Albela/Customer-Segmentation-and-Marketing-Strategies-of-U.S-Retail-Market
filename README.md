# A Comparative Study of Customer Segmentation and Marketing Strategies of U.S Retail Market

## Project Overview

This analysis is a strategic data analytics case study focused on customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies for the U.S. mall retail market. Built using **Power BI**, this project explores how traditional shopping malls can adapt to evolving consumer behavior in the age of e-commerce by leveraging RFM modeling, Pareto analysis, and demographic insights.

## *This project is my original work, developed as part of my college capstone for MBA specializing in Business Analytics.*

## Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior across age, gender, and payment preferences
- Segment customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics
- Identify high-value segments and churn risks
- Apply Pareto principles to uncover revenue concentration
- Recommend actionable strategies to boost loyalty and lifetime value
- Explore conversion opportunities from non-retail footfall (food courts, play zones)

---

## Key Insights

- **60% of customers** still prefer offline shopping for Clothing, Shoes, and Technology
- **Revenue is concentrated** among fewer high-value customers, especially in the Consumer segment
- **Female customers** contribute over **60% of total revenue**, with higher transaction volumes
- **Cash dominates** as the preferred payment method, but Credit Card users show higher revenue per transaction
- **Shopping Mall A** leads in sales, indicating strong offline engagement
- **Food courts and entertainment zones** present untapped conversion potential

---

## Strategic Recommendations

- Implement **RFM-based loyalty programs** for recent and high-value customers
- Use **geo-targeted promotions** and **cross-zone bundling** to convert leisure visitors
- Offer **exclusive offline benefits** and personalized campaigns to reduce churn
- Optimize **payment incentives** to encourage high-margin transactions
- Monitor **operational efficiency** in underperforming malls to manage costs
- E-commerce has transformed retail, but strategies vary across sectors.

Amazon mastered large-scale warehouse logistics, while Zepto and Blinkit built dense dark-store networks to handle perishables and ensure speed. Walmart, meanwhile, balances scale and freshness through automated and store-level fulfillment.

These models show that retail canâ€™t rely on a one-size-fits-all approach success depends on blending centralized warehouses with localized delivery.

I believe collaboration between e-commerce giants and local retailers could further cut warehouse costs and enable faster, more sustainable fulfillment.
